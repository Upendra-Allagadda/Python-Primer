# Python Programming Basics for Experienced Developers

This file provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Python's fundamental concepts, offering a simplified introduction to the language's key elements, making it an ideal starting point for gaining a solid understanding.

## Writing Your First Python Program

1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `hello.py`) using a code editor.
2. Add the following code to print "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
print("Hello World!!")
```

## Variables and Data Types

Python supports various data types:

```python
# Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Alice"

# Boolean
is_student = True
```

## Basic Operations

Perform arithmetic and logical operations:

```python
# Arithmetic
sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
division = x / y
remainder = x % 3

# Logical
and_result = True and False
or_result = True or False
not_result = not True
```

## Conditional Statements

Make decisions with conditional statements:

```python
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")
else:
    print("x is less than y")
```

## Loops

Execute code repeatedly using loops:

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```

## Lists and Dictionaries

Explore common data structures:

```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "is_student": False}
```

## Functions

Create reusable code blocks with functions:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")
```

## Input and Output

Interact with users using input and output:

```python
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + user_input + "!")
```

## Comments

Document your code using comments:

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

## Exception Handling

Handle errors gracefully using try-except blocks:

```python
try:
  result = x / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("Error: Division by zero")
```
