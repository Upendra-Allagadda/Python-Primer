# Programming Assignments

## Class Inheritance and Method Overriding

Create a base class `Vehicle` with attributes `make`, `model`, and a method `display_info()` that prints the make and model. Then, create two subclasses `Car` and `Motorcycle` that inherit from `Vehicle`. Override the `display_info()` method in each subclass to display additional information specific to cars and motorcycles.

## Abstract Base Class and Polymorphism

Define an abstract base class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`. Create subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` that inherit from `Shape`. Implement the `area()` method in each subclass to calculate and return the area of the respective shapes. Write a function that takes a list of shapes and prints their areas.

## Exception Handling

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer input. Use a `try` and `except` block to handle the case where the user enters a non-integer value. Print an error message if the input cannot be converted to an integer.

## File Handling

Write a program that reads a text file and counts the number of occurrences of each word in the file. Create a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the counts. Print the dictionary.

## Functional Programming

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. Use the `filter()` function along with a lambda function to achieve this.

## Advanced Data Structures

Implement a simple stack data structure using a Python list. Create methods `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()` to manipulate the stack. Test your stack by pushing and popping elements.

## Object-Oriented Design

Design a simple banking system with classes `Bank`, `Account`, and `Transaction`. Create methods for opening accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and displaying account details. Use encapsulation and proper design principles.

## Regular Expressions

Write a program that validates email addresses. Prompt the user to enter an email address and check if it matches a valid email pattern using regular expressions.

## Modules and Packages

Create a Python module that defines functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Use this module in another script to perform calculations.

## Lambda Functions and Sorting

Create a list of tuples, each containing a name and an age. Sort the list based on age using the `sorted()` function and a lambda function as the key.
